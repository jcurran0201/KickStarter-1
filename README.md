# Kickstarter Written Analysis of the Results 
## Overview Of The Kickstarter Project  
### Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to find out what performing arts projects were successful, failures, or canceled based on how much funding they needed and what month of the year they were launched.  
### Background 
The data broke the type of performing arts projects down into parent categories and subcategories. We were looking specifically at what theater projects were successful, failures, or canceled based on the month they were launched. We broke down funding goals VS successful, failure, or canceled rate for theatrical plays (plays was a subcategory under theater). 
## Analysis and Challenges  
### What was Found in Outcomes Based on Launch Dates?   
#### Most Successful Launch Months 
We found that the three most successful launch dates for Theater projects based on month were May (111 successful projects), June (100 successful projects), and July (87 successful projects). The month of April was the beginning of an upward trajectory of successful projects because there was an increase of 15 more successful projects in April than there were in March. We then saw a major spike in successful projects from May-July that was not seen the rest of the year. After July, there was a steady decrease in the number of successful projects and December was ultimately the month that saw the least number of successful projects.  
#### Least Successful Launch Months 
The three least successful launch dates for Theater projects based on month were December (37 successful projects), November (54 successful projects), and January/March (56 successful projects). December was the only month that had an unusually low number of successful projects. November, January, and March only saw minor setbacks in the number of successful shows compared to the rest of the year. The decrease into the winter months started steadily in August and then suddenly hit a low point in December.  
#### Failed Projects 
The number of failed projects for Theater projects stayed kept a stagnant pace for most of the year with small jumps in May (52 failed projects), July/October, 50 failed projects), and June (47 failed projects). The number of canceled projects ranged from 3-7 projects throughout the calendar year. Thereâ€™s a stagnant pace of failures throughout the calendar year and the uptick in successes from May-July.  
#### 4 Best Months to Launch Theater Projects  
1.	December 
2.	October
3.	January
4.	March

### What Was Found in Outcomes Based on Goals?   
#### Fundraising goals under $5,000.00 USD 
It was found that play projects were most likely to be successful if their funding goal was under $5,000.00 USD. Projects under $1,000.00 USD had a 76% success rate and projects between $1,000.00 and $4,999.00 USD had a 73% success rate. Play projects with fundraising goals under $5,000.00 USD accounted for approximately 70% of all the play projects.  
#### Fundraising goals between $5,000.00-$29,999.00 USD 
Projects that had a fundraising goal between $5,000.00 and $29,999.00 USD saw a large decrease in successful projects as the fundraising goal increased. There was a slight uptick in success for projects with fundraising goals of $30,000.00-$34,999.00, but projects that had goals in that price range were still only 27% successful in reaching their goal. 
#### Fundraising goals over $35,000.00 USD 
There were only 10 projects that had fundraising goals ranging from $35,000.00-$44,999.00 and they were successful a little under 2/3 of the time (one project that was looking for fundraising in the $45,000.00-$49,999.00 range failed). There were 12 projects that wanted over $50,000.00 and only 2 succeeded. There were zero canceled projects found in the data.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered  
One challenge that was faced with this data set was that I had to make a whole new data table and use different functions based off the original data to find out the outcomes of play projects based on their fundraising goals in order to find out and create a chart to show what fundraising goal price ranges had the most successful projects.  
## Results 
### Two Conclusions about Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?   
1.	It is best to launch projects in the summer months. 
2.	Do not launch projects in around the holiday season (especially in the month of December). 
### One Conclusion about Outcomes Based on Goals?  
Keeping fundraising goals under $5,000.00 is a recipe for success. Anything more than $5,000.00 and your chances of success drop as the fundraising goal increases. 
### What are some Limitations of this Dataset?  
 A major limitation of the dataset was that there was a lack of data for some categories and subcategories. There was also a lack of data for amount of money that projects were looking for. There was a lot less data for expensive funding goals, which makes it harder to see if projects that have high funding goals end up being successful. 
 ### What are some other Possible Tables or Graphs that we could create? 
 We would create other tables or graphs using different categories and subcategories to compare the success of types of performing arts against one another based on time of the year and fundraising goals. We can also make tables or graphs to find out how much money successful, failed, and canceled projects are raising based on what their goal price is (this would require three different graphs, one for each result).
