# Kickstarter Written Analysis of the Results 
## Overview Of The Kickstarter Project  
### Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to find out what performing arts projects were successful, failures, or canceled based on how much funding they needed and what month of the year they were launched.  
### Background 
The data broke the type of performing arts projects down into parent categories and subcategories. We were looking specifically at what theater projects were successful, failures, or canceled based on the month they were launched. We broke down funding goals VS successful, failure, or canceled rate for theatrical plays (plays was a subcategory under theater).
